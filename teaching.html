										<h2 class="ds-heading">Teaching Statement</h2>

									<p>As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to be a TA for the Workshop Physics class 
									series (Mechanics + Electricity and Magnetism). As a TA, I assisted with class sessions 
									and lead twice weekly sessions in which students were able to ask questions about homework 
									and course content.  This opportunity transformed my ideas of STEM education and what a STEM
									 class could look like.  It led me to realize that physics instruction did not have to be 
									 limited to lectures. Instead, students were able to learn by doing and doing collaboratively. 
									 Even as I continue to gain new teaching experience and education, this initial teaching 
									 experience remains an important influence on my ideas of teaching.</p>

									<p><strong>Instruction and Assessment</strong></p>
									<p>Challenges and failure are central aspects of engineering education.  Engineering classes 
										should teach students not only the concepts that can help students address challenges, but 
										also the skills to identify the problem and potential next steps they can take to resolve it.  
										As a student however, I found this consistent sense of failure to be stressful and intimidating. 
										Through instruction and assessment, however, I think educators can transform these challenges and 
										failures into what makes the subject exciting and engaging. To do this there are two different 
										methods that I intend to utilize.  </p>
									<p>1)	A creative reframing of familiar ideas to new ones: In the Workshop Physics course I assisted with,
										 circuits were taught not by lecturing on Ohmâ€™s Law, but instead through experimentation with fluids.  
										 Students were able to physically see and quantify how current would flow through a circuit in the same 
										 way as fluid traveling through pipes.  This led students to have a better understanding and intuition 
										 about the relationships between different components in a circuit.  I have found that a similar strategy 
										 works well in ECE 270 (Fields and Waves).  Most students in electrical engineering are very comfortable 
										 with waves through transmission lines, but less so with electromagnetic waves.  By directly drawing parallels
										  between the key concepts of the two topics, students are not only better able to solve electromagnetics problems, 
										  but they are also able to see the connections between the different topics within the course.  </p>
										<p>2)	Frequent opportunities to participate and check understanding:  As a Lab TA for ECE 270, checking 
										in with students throughout the lab session is an important aspect of instruction.  It provides an opportunity for 
										me to ensure students are connecting the experiments to key ideas in the class as well as gives students a chance 
										to ask questions they might not ask in front of the entire class. This regular informal opportunity to ask questions
										 or to think more critically about a concept is something that I have found to be beneficial across classes that 
										 I have been a TA for and been a student in. Checking in with students could also be done through written responses 
										 submitted prior to each class to provide feedback that can be incorporated into the class session or could be through 
										 active learning exercises such as think-pair-share incorporated into a lecture class.  Collaborative learning provides 
										 students to further opportunity to participate, check understanding, and support each other.  Group problem solving encourages 
										 teamwork and discussion which can lead to a better understanding of the content and ability to share and formulate ideas. </p>
										<p><strong>Learning by doing and discovery</strong></p>
										<p>One of the reasons I love leading lab sessions is because the learning is focused on asking and addressing questions rather 
											than obtaining correct solutions.  Because of this I can see the variety of ways in which students approach a problem or a 
											task and how they strengthen each other when they work together to determine steps forward. By providing students with the 
											tools and the support to discover the course material students are empowered to become experts in the content, even though 
											they might be early in their studies.  Through combining the underlying theory corresponding to a concept with experiment or 
											simulation, students are not only able to state their results but are also challenged to discuss the questions of why or how 
											those results came about. As students practice their problem solving both in groups and individually, they can address continually 
											more challenging problems and projects. </p>
										<p>Lab work not only allows students to visualize concepts, but also teaches skills that are necessary for work after graduation.  Lab 
										work teaches tangible things such as how and when to use an oscilloscope, as well as how to ask meaningful questions, develop reproduceable
										 experiments, and work within a team.  Beyond being necessary for design and research challenges students may encounter in the future, effective 
										problem solving is transferrable to every discipline and occupation.  </p>
										<p><strong>Science Communication</strong></p>
										<p>Writing, visual representations, and presentations are just as important in STEM fields as in any other discipline. In undergraduate education, 
											writing lab reports is central to the practice of science communication.  Lab reports should not only teach students how to state their procedure 
											and findings, but also communicate the significance of the experiment, any theory that directly relates to the experiment, and discussion of 
											the results and next steps.  As an educator, I would love to incorporate reading and written responses to current and historical scientific 
											articles into engineering courses.  This would expose students to a variety of areas within the field that may help students to see potential 
											applications of the content they are learning as well as provide framework and examples for thinking about both research and communication.  </p> 
										<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
										<p>I am continually learning and growing as I gain teaching experience and education. One area of development that I continued to work on 
											with each iteration of ECE 270 was trying to explain from the perspective of where students are in their learning.  Without an 
											electrical engineering background, the concepts that were most intuitive for me were often very challenging for students whereas the areas in 
											which students excel and want more information, I found challenging to explain. As I learned the material more deeply and explored different
											 approaches and explanations, I found that I was better able to ask students questions that could guide them in their studies and address 
											 student concerns related to the course content.  Student feedback and evaluations have also helped me to reflect on my teaching practices 
											 and how they can be changed and adapted in future semesters. In future teaching, I also hope to gain experience with larger more lecture 
											 focused class formats and access strategies on how to incorporate hand-on and engaging learning within that setting. </p>
											<p>In addition to gaining teaching experience, I continue to seek out additional pedagogical training through pursuing the Certificate
										 of College Teaching.  Through courses and participating in the Teaching Triangles program, I have continually learned and reflected 
										 on various course structures and teaching strategies.</p>
