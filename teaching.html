										<h2 class="ds-heading">Teaching Statement</h2>

									<p>As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to be a TA for the Workshop Physics class 
									series (Mechanics + Electricity and Magnetism). As a TA, I assisted with class sessions 
									and lead twice weekly sessions in which students were able to ask questions about homework 
									and course content.  This opportunity transformed my ideas of STEM education and what a STEM
									 class could look like.  It led me to realize that physics instruction did not have to be 
									 limited to lectures. Instead, students were able to learn by doing and doing collaboratively. 
									 Even as I continue to gain new teaching experience and education, this initial teaching 
									 experience remains an important influence on my ideas of teaching.</p>

									<div class = "ds-header-teaching">Instruction and Assessment</div>
									<p>Challenges and failure are central aspects of engineering education.  Engineering classes should teach 
										students not only the concepts that can help students address challenges, but also the skills to identify 
										the problem and potential next steps they can take to resolve it.  As a student however, I found this consistent
										 sense of failure to be stressful and intimidating. Through instruction and assessment, however, I think
										  educators can transform these challenges and failures into what makes the subject exciting and engaging.
										   To do this there are two different methods that I intend to utilize.    </p>
									<p>1)   A creative reframing of familiar ideas to new ones: In the Workshop Physics course I assisted with, 
										circuits were taught not by lecturing on Ohmâ€™s Law, but instead through experimentation with fluids.  Students
										 were able to physically see and quantify how current would flow through a circuit in the same way as fluid 
										 traveling through pipes.  This led students to have a better understanding and intuition about the relationships
										  between different components in a circuit.  I have found that a similar strategy works well in the electrical 
										  engineering course Fields and Waves.  Most students in electrical engineering were very comfortable with waves 
										  through transmission lines, but less so with electromagnetic waves.  By directly drawing parallels between the 
										  key concepts of the two topics, students were not only better able to solve electromagnetics problems, but they
										   were also able to see the connections between the different topics within the course.   </p>
										<p>2)	Frequent opportunities to participate and check understanding:  As a Lab TA for Fields and Waves, 
											checking in with students and asking them questions throughout the lab session served as an important
											 method of instruction.  It provided an opportunity for me to ensure students were connecting the experiments 
											 to key ideas in the lecture as well as gave students a chance to ask questions they might not ask in front of 
											 the entire class. This regular informal opportunity to ask questions and think more critically about a concept
											  is an element that I intend to incorporate into any class that I may teach.  This could be through written 
											  responses submitted prior to each class to provide feedback that can be utilized within the class session or 
											  could be through active learning exercises incorporated into a primarily lecture focused class.  Collaborative 
											  learning provides students to further opportunity to participate, check understanding, and support each other. 
											   Group problem solving encourages teamwork and discussion which can lead to a better understanding of the
											content and ability to share and formulate ideas.  </p>
										 <div class = "ds-header-teaching">Learning by doing and discovery</div>
										<p>One of the reasons I love leading lab sessions is because the learning is focused on asking and addressing questions rather than obtaining 
											correct solutions.  Because of this I have been able to see the variety of ways in which students approach a problem or a task and how they 
											strengthen each other when they work together to determine steps forward. This type of learning should not be limited to laboratory courses, 
											rather it can be utilized more expansively to promote practical, collaborative, and discovery-based learning in all types of classes.  By providing
											 students with the tools and the support to discover the course material students are empowered to become experts in the content, even though they 
											 might be early in their studies.  Through combining the underlying theory corresponding to a concept with experiment or simulation, students are 
											 not only able to state their results but are also challenged to discuss the questions of why or how those results came about. As students practice
											  their problem solving both in groups and individually, they can address continually more challenging problems and projects. Beyond being necessary
											   for design and research challenges students may encounter in the future, effective problem solving is transferrable to every discipline and occupation.    </p>
										<div class = "ds-header-teaching">Science Communication</div>
										<p>Writing, visual representations, and presentations are just as important in STEM fields as in any other discipline. Lab reports are a great place 
											for students to start learning how to communicate the significance of the experiment, describe theory that relates to the experiment, and discuss the 
											procedure and results.  As an educator, I would love to incorporate reading and written responses to current and historical scientific articles into 
											engineering courses.  This would expose students to a variety of areas within the field that may help students to see potential applications of the 
											content they are learning as well as provide framework and examples for thinking about both research and communication.     </p> 
											<div class = "ds-header-teaching">Development</div>
										<p>I am continually learning and growing as I gain teaching experience and education. One area of development that I continued to work on with each 
											iteration of Fields and Waves was trying to explain from the perspective of where students are in their learning.  Without an electrical 
											engineering background, the concepts that were most intuitive for me were often very challenging for students whereas the areas in which students 
											excel and want more information, I found challenging to explain. As I learned the material more deeply and explored different approaches and 
											explanations, I found that I was better able to ask students questions that could guide them in their studies and address student concerns 
											related to the course content.  Student feedback and evaluations have also helped me to reflect on my teaching practices and how they can 
											be changed and adapted in future semesters. In future teaching, I also hope to gain experience with larger more lecture focused class 
											formats and access strategies on how to incorporate hand-on and engaging learning within that setting.  </p>
											<p>In addition to gaining teaching experience, I continue to seek out additional pedagogical training through pursuing the Certificate of College Teaching. 
												 Through courses and participating in the Teaching Triangles program, in which I had the opportunity to both observe and be observed by fellow teaching 
												 assistants, I have continually learned and reflected on various course structures and teaching strategies. I am also currently participating in the Preparing 
												 Future Faculty program where I have had the opportunity for mentorship from a current faculty member at partner institutions. </p>
